Parkinson's Detection via Speech Pattern Recognition

Early detection of Parkinson's disease is key. If it is caught early, there are many treatments
to slow the progression of the disease. Using an audio dataset, I extract the 
features of each recording, and run it through a deep neural net to predict if the person has Parkinson's.
